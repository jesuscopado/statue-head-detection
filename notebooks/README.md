# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks that serve as a comprehensive record of the exploratory data analysis, model training, and experimentation process carried out during the development of the Statue Head Detection project.

## Overview

The notebooks are intended to provide insight into the decision-making process, the exploratory analysis performed on the data, and the iterative approach taken in building and refining the model. They are structured as a diary, capturing the progression of the project, including successes, challenges, and learned lessons.

**Note**: The code within these notebooks is in a raw and exploratory form. This means that parts of the code may be repeated, and the structure might not be as clean or linear as production-ready scripts.

## Key Features

- **Reproducibility**: The notebooks are designed to be self-contained, ensuring that you can run them from start to finish and achieve the same results consistently.
- **Compatibility with Google Colab**: These notebooks can be easily imported and run in Google Colab, providing a flexible and powerful cloud-based environment for data analysis and model training.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Each notebook contains detailed comments and markdown cells that explain the purpose and outcome of each code block, making the thought process and analysis accessible and understandable.

## Usage

To get the most out of these notebooks:

1. **Local Setup**:
    - Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed in your virtual environment.
    - Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
    - Open the notebook of your choice and run the cells in sequence from top to bottom.

2. **Google Colab**:
    - Upload the notebook to your Google Drive.
    - Open the notebook with Google Colab.
    - Ensure that the runtime type is set to Python and that any necessary packages are installed (as per the requirements in the `requirements.txt` file of the main project).

## Best Practices

- **Sequential Execution**: Run the cells in order, as later cells might depend on code or variables from earlier cells.
- **Environment Consistency**: If running the notebooks locally, ensure that your environment matches the requirements specified in the `requirements.txt` file to avoid dependency-related issues.
- **Interactive Exploration**: Feel free to tweak parameters, modify the code, and run individual cells to experiment with different aspects of the analysis and model.
